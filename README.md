# SnakeGame

This is a basic Snake Game web app implemented with a Node.js server.

## Running the Server

To run the server, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

This will start the server on the default port (3000). You can access the game by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

Enjoy the game!
